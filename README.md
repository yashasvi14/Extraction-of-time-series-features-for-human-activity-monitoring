# Extraction-of-time-series-features-for-human-activity-monitoring
The objective of the project is to extract time series features for human activity monitoring for 15 subjects. This project considers accelerometer data for all the 15
subjects for walking, running, climbing up and climbing down.
Following tasks were performed:
1. Applied natural visibility graph (NVG) and horizontal visibility graph (HVG) to the aforementioned data
2. Computed average degree, network diameter, and average path length
3. Selected sample size of 1024 data points for each of the 15 time series
4. Tabulated all the results
5. Generated scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points according to walking and running for each accelerometer signal and each method (HVH and NVG))
6. Generated scatter plots: average degree vs network diameter and color the points according to climbing up and climbing down for each accelerometer signal and each method (HVH and NVG))
7. Computed permutation entropy and complexity for the aforementioned data considering the accelerometer data in all three direction
8. Generated scatter plots: permutation entropy vs complexity and colored the points according to walking and running
9. Generated scatter plots: permutation entropy vs complexity and colored the points according to climbing up and climbing down
